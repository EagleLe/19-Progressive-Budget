# 19-Progressive-Budget

Add functionality to the tracker to track budget offline or online. When the transaction is offline, it should populate again when online. I could not get this to deploy on heroku, but I have attached a screenshot and video file here showing the app running on a localhost. 
Update: I got it deployed on Heroku: failed to connect to mongodb and some port issues but it is now fixed and up and running.
